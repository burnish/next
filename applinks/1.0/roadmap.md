This first version of Up Next is deliberately small. It's the second podcast app I've made, and I learned a hard lesson with the first one that it's very easy to bite off more than you can chew.

No promises with any of these things, I wish I could dedicate enough time to this that I could get throuh them all for a version 2, but I don't anticipate that making financial sense.

## Now Playing View

Most podcast apps seem to have a screen that is dedicated to the now playing episode. Typically a large image with the show artwork, a scrubber, play/pause/skip buttons etc. This has been deliberately omitted to start off with. After using this app for many months, it is clear to me I do need some way to more easily seek around within an episode. I'll either add a now playing screen, or some sort of scrubber.

## Download Manager

Ultimately I want a hands off download manager that just knows you need the next couple of episodes of each show. But sometimes you still want to just go in and tweak things. Like before you get on a flight load up all the episodes of your current favourite show. Or when you are running particularly low on space.

## Show Level Settings

 - Skip duration
 - Intro/Outro skip
 - Download preferences

## Sharing

Both the ability to share a current episode that you particularly enjoyed, or your current list of shows.

## Wider Platform Support
 
One of the advantages of a simple app is that it should be reltively easy to make it available on other platforms. I personally miss Up Next while I'm using my iPad, and it would be fun to try out tvOS.

## Better Local Playback on Watch

This is one area I will be keen to jump into as soon as new APIs are available for better playback on the watch. I just want to be able to go for a run without my phone, and conveniently listen to episodes.

## News Mode

I have to credit my favourite other podcast app [Castro][castro], at least for the name. But some shows do work best in a "news mode" where only the most recent episode is relevant. I'm still not sure whether it fits in Up Next, but I'm trying not to be dogmatic, and it is under consideration.
