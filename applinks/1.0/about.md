Thanks for trying out this beta for "Up Next" (or whatever I'm going to call it).



## Suspected bugs

There are a couple of bugs seen in previous builds, that to my knowledge have been stamped out. Let me know if you come across them.

 - New episodes don't arrive. When you are up to date on a show, the artwork is dimmed. If it stays in this state after you suspect new episodes *should* be available, you can tap on the episode list icon (three lines in the bottom right after tapping on the artwork).

 - Forgets playback position. Seems most likely to occur if you are playing an episode in the background and it is interupped

## Known bugs

Don't worry about reporting any of these:

 - Local playback on the watch doesn't work. Experimental at best â€“ it's disabled by default.

  - Now playing (lock screen or control center) can be a bit unreliable. (For example the playback position stops updating). Seems to happen most when you scrub/skip around a lot.

  - Cloud icon (sometimes) still shows after episode is downloaded.
