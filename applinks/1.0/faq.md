## What if I want to skip an episode?

When a podcast is selected you get a brief description of the current episode. Swipe left or right for other episodes. There is also a button to choose from a list of all available episodes.

## I selected "Start from the beginning", but didn't get episode one.

Some podcasts don't make their full back catalogue of episodes available (for example, This American Life tends to only have a few recent episodes).
