  <h1 class="page-heading">Up Next</h1>

  <p>
    Some podcasts warrant listening to every episode, in order. Up Next is a ruthlessly simple app, designed for just that.
  </p>
  
  <p> 
   One tap to resume where you left off 
  </p>

  <p> 
    Listen at your pace.
  </p>

  <p> 
    This works just as well for catching up with old episodes of a podcast, or staying up to date with new episodes of your current favourites.
